**Flight Delay Analysis | U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics Project**

• Analyzed close to a million flight records using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to identify delay patterns across airports and carriers

• Performed comprehensive analyses such as airline delay rate rankings, airport-level delay aggregation, and root cause breakdowns along with identifying top delayed airports, comparing delay causes across carriers,and visualizing delay patterns using grouping, aggregation, and data visualization techniques in Python.

• Discovered that over 22% of monthly flights were delayed, with the leading causes being NAS (National Airspace System) disruptions and late aircraft issues

**Impact:** Showcased ability to turn raw flight data into meaningful insights, demonstrating strong analytical thinking, problem-solving, and Python-based data analysis skills.
