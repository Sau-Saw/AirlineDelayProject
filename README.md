**Flight Delay Analysis | U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics Project**

Analyzed and interpreted close to a million U.S. flight records from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to uncover patterns and insights that can help airlines improve operational efficiency.

Engineered and cleaned complex datasets using Python libraries including pandas and NumPy, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming timestamps for analysis.

Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using matplotlib and seaborn, including airline delay rate rankings, airport-level delay aggregation, root cause breakdowns, and visualizing delay patterns.

Identified actionable insights, such as high-delay routes, peak delay periods, top delayed airports, and carrier-specific performance trends, providing recommendations for reducing delays.

Discovered that over 22% of monthly flights were delayed, with leading causes being NAS (National Airspace System) disruptions and late aircraft issues.

Developed proficiency in the Python data analysis stack—pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn—strengthening data manipulation and visualization skills.

Documented workflow and findings clearly in Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating ability to communicate technical insights effectively.

**Impact:** Showcased ability to turn raw flight data into meaningful insights, demonstrating strong analytical thinking, problem-solving, and Python-based data analysis skills.
