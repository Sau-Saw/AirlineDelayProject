**Airline 
Delay Project**

Analyzed and interpreted flight delay data to uncover patterns and insights that can help airlines improve operational efficiency.

Engineered and cleaned complex datasets using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming timestamps for analysis.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using matplotlib and seaborn, creating visualizations that highlighted key trends in delays across airlines, airports, and time periods.

Identified actionable insights, including high-delay routes, peak delay periods, and airline-specific performance trends, providing recommendations for reducing delays.

Developed proficiency in Python data analysis stack, including pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn, strengthening both data manipulation and visualization skills.

Documented workflow and findings clearly using Jupyter Notebook markdown, making the project easy to follow and demonstrating ability to communicate technical insights effectively.

Impact: Showcased ability to turn raw flight data into meaningful insights, demonstrating strong analytical thinking, problem-solving, and Python-based data analysis skills.
